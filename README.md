# Collection of DATA STRUCTURE
## All Algorithm will be made with C and C++

### C
#### &nbsp; key: int, value: char*

### C++
#### &nbsp; key, value: template<typename K, typename V>
#
1. Linked List
2. AVL ( Blanced Binary Search Tree )
3. B-tree
4. B+ tree
5. B* tree

## Current Added
B-tree

<br></br>

### Comment
*** 
In C compiler <br/>
if class was declared with template, header and implement file can't be divided.<br/>
So, all implementations will be in the header file. (C++)
